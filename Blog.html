			<strong>Sometime in 2009:</strong><br>
			A few days before my parents were getting married, I was roaming around the preparation and stumbled upon<br>
			my uncle, who was fishing. He was equipped with a tri-hook, and I happened to be standing too close as he<br>
			went to cast, and I was greeted with a tri-hook snatching my right cheek.<br>
			Me being a little kid, started freaking out and crying while my uncle was laughing.

				<strong>Tuesday, March 3, 2020:</strong><br>
				Today I had a dream where I sat inside a car and apparently I shared it with another guy and we used it to get to work.<br>
			Then all of the sudden I was in a building which I guess it was school, and there were giant cracks in the floor.<br>
			So I started to pick stuff out of them and I found all kinds of rubble and other things.
